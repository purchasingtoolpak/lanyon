## Procurement Decreases Inbound Freight Costs 

Purchasing Agents use the transportation template to survey suppliers for inbound shipping data. The template identifies inbound lanes, carriers, and freight cost information. The survey requests information on both full truckload and less than truckload shipments.

This is week seven of ten templates in ten weeks. Be sure to check out the procurement templates from weeks one through six.

- Supplier preferences for high performing carriers
- Special material handling requirements
