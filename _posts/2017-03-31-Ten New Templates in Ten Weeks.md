title: Ten New Templates in Ten Weeks
published: true
---

I've spend considerable time setting up PurchasingToolpak.com using GitHub and Jekyll. Now I'd like to start giving back to the purchasing community by publishing even more free procurement templates.

As each template is published, I'll post a new blog about the template and how to use it. These templates will help buyers improve their productivity and knowledge for their respective organization.

Stay tuned for the next 10 weeks.
