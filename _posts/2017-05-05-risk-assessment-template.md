The purpose of the risk assessment template is to identify areas of high supply risk. The Excel template can be used on a category or product level. Use this Excel template to maintain or improve purchasing power. <!--more-->

Areas of supply risk to be evaluated are:

1. **Industry** - overall industry factors like supplier consolidation and barriers to entry.
2. **Supplier** - review of historical supply outages, predatory practices, and financial viability.
3. **Product** - material or service related risks like patent restrictions.
4. **Supply Chain** - long lead time or manufacturing located in a high-risk region.
5. **Internal** - erratic demand or resource limitations.  

### When to use the supplier risk assessment template:
There are three ways to use this template in the procurement process. One, as part of a department wide supply risk program. Two, during the supplier selection process. And three, after a supply disruption occurs for any reason. Pro-actively identifying areas of supply risk helps maintain purchasing power.
