This is week four of ten new templates in ten weeks. If you are new to this blog, be sure to check out the procurement templates from weeks one, two and three:

 Week 1:	[sourcing strategy template]({{site.baseurl}}/2017/04/07/sourcing-strategy-template)

 Week 2:	[request for quotation template]({{site.baseurl}}/2017/04/14/request-for-quotation-template)

 Week 3:	[request for quotation template]({{site.baseurl}}/2017/04/21/supplier-cost-improvement-template)

The flexible scorecard template can be used with most buying categories.  The scorecard template can be easily customized to address the unique requirements of the buying category. For example, this template could scorecard both goods and services suppliers.

This template has five major attributes with three sub-attributes stating the scorecard criteria. A rating scale of one to five is used for each sub-attribute. Each major attribute is weighted with a total weight not to exceed 100%.

The major attributes are:

1. **Supplier Innovation** - application of creative ideas, best practices, and technology that results in increased effectiveness of the buyer's organization.
2. **Quality** - the compliance to buyer's specifications and industry standards.
3. **Support** - proactive supplier response to meet the needs for quality, service, cost and technical support.
4. **Delivery** - the ability to meet delivery requirements. The ease of doing business to support "end to end" supply chain needs.
5. **Cost and Contract** - an ability to provide total least cost solutions to the buyer's organization.

A meets expectations score for each sub-attribute would be a rating of 3 out of 5. The template has red or green conditional formating to highlight below or above expectations.
