The flexible scrorecard template can be used with most buying categories.  The scorecard template can be easily customized to address the unique requirements of the buying category. For example, this template could scorecard both goods and services suppliers.

This template has five major attributes with three sub-attributes stating the scorecard criteria. A rating scale of one to five is used for each sub-attribute. Each major attribute is weighted with a total weight not to exeed 100%.

A meets expectations score for each sub attribute would be a rating of 3 out of 5. The template has red or green conditional formating to highlight below or above expectations.
