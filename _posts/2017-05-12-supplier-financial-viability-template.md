Before using the financial viability template complete the <a href="/2017/05/05/risk-assessment-template/">risk assessment template</a>.  Key questions regarding supplier, industry, and product risks are provided in the risk assessment.

The financial viability template has several key ratios. Definitions below are from Investopedia.

- **Quick Ratio** - measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.
- **Debt / Equity** - indicates what portion of equity and debt the company is using to finance its assets.
- **Operating Cash Flow** - the cash generated from the operations of a company.

These ratios provide the status and progress. How bad is the situation? Is this supplier making progress over time?
