### Segment Key Suppliers During Strategy Development

This is the tenth procurement template, in our series 10 free procurement templates in 10 weeks. Procurement uses the relationship segmentation template to segment buying categories and suppliers.

### Suppliers are Segmented into Three Tiers

The procurement sourcing team scores economic and compatibility criteria on a scale of one through five. In all, there are 10 criteria for evaluation. The rating scale for determining each tier is as follows;

* **Tier 1 Strategic Relationship** - score greater than 20 points
* **Tier 2 Preferred Relationship** - score greater than 15 and less than 20
* **Tier 3 Transactional Relationship** - score less than 15

### Economic Drivers for Relationship Assessment ###

The five economic areas evaluated by the procurement sourcing team are:
1. **Buyer View of Category** - buying category assessment from transactional (low value) to strategic (high value)
2. **Supply Chain Impact** - the probability that supplier will partner to significantly optimize total cost and value.
3. **Innovation Potential** - supplier's capability to increase innovation for our organization
4. **Profit Stability/Growth** - the financial and economic strength of supplier's company
5. **Supplier View of Buyer** - the relative importance of our company and organization to the supplier

### Compatibility Drivers for Relationship assessment ###

The five compatibility areas evaluation by the procurement sourcing team are:
1. **Strategic Fit** - overall fit of business strategies of the supplier
2. **Processes & Technology** - compatibility of supplier's business processes and technology
3. **Close Proximity** - supplier participates in similar or compatible market
4. **Assets & Resources** - degree to which a supplier partnership can share assets and resources
5. **Corporate Compatibility** - commitment and support to partnering for achievement of long-term goals
