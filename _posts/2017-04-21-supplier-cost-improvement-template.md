If you are looking for a way to increase the pipeline of cost reduction projects - a fantastic resource is to go to your key suppliers for ideas. New and existing suppliers are typically willing to share ideas. This is a great way to increase collaboration with suppliers in a positive / sharing way. <!--more-->

Using supplier resources for cost reduction ideas, documenting results and sharing benefits goes back to the Chrysler SCORE (Supplier Cost Reduction Effort) program. I like this quote from Bob Lutz president of Chrysler operations,  in a meeting with the top 25 suppliers he said; "All I want is your brainpower, not your margins".  For more details check out these resources <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~afuah/cases/case3.html"> Innovations In Supply Chain Management</a> a University of Michigan case study and <a href="https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/sourcing_procurement_supply_chain_management_buyer_supplier_collaboration_roadmap_for_success/"> Buyer-Supplier Collaboration A Roadmap for Success written by BCG</a>.

The supplier cost improvement template is organized into four sections:

1. **The first section is completed by the supplier**. A description of the cost improvement idea is detailed. The supplier assesses the potential impacts to quality and the environment.  A savings estimate is provided along with the costs to implement.
2. **Procurement completes the second section.** Contract implications are reviewed and the buyer identifies the source of the cost improvement idea.
3. **Section three is completed by R&D/Engineering.** The objective of this section is to scope the project. Key areas to evaluate are challenges, risks, success factors and capital needs. A project feasibility rating is assigned.
4. **The last section recommends next steps for the project.**

If your organization has 25 key suppliers and each supplier provides 10 ideas - a total of 250 projects would need review. The objective is to identify projects with a high probability of success and above average cost benefits with minimal impact to quality or growth.
