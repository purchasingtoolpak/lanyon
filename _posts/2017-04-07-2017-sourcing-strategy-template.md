## Sourcing Strategy Template

### Week One of Ten Templates in Ten Weeks

The strategic sourcing template is the first procurement template in our series - ten templates in ten weeks. This template does not follow the 7 step strategic sourcing methodology - however it is an easy and intuitive tool for developing category sourcing strategies. Some of the benefits of this strategy template are:

- It requires less training to implement 
- Uses less resources to implement
- Prompts buyers with questions to answer important to all buying categories
- Incorporates external feedback from suppliers and internal customers
- Can be used for a broad range of buying categories
- Strategy developed in a 6 page Word document, limits big Power Point decks

Three key areas assessed with the sourcing strategy template one; industry, two; supplier and three; internal assessment of business and stakeholder needs.

Below some snapshots from the procurement sourcing strategy template:
