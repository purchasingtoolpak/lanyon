Purchasing uses the project charter template to document and track cost reduction initiatives.  Each buyer in the purchasing department completes project charters. The project charter slides are typically collated into a purchasing department presentation. The template file format is Microsoft PowerPoint.

In a one-page summary, the project charter template provides information about key cost reduction initiatives. Key areas to complete on the project charter template include:

- **Team objectives** - state the key project objectives; e.g.  sourcing strategy for corrugated packaging category.
- **Savings Estimates** - provide estimated and target savings.
- **Approach** - provide the approach to be used to achieve the team objectives. An approach could be supplier consolidation or alternate supplier qualification to increase competition.
- **Scope** - define the specific focus of the project along with addressable spend.
- **Key Milestone** - state the key tasks and expected completion dates
- **Project Team** - identify the project resources.
- **Project Stakeholders** - indicate which key stakeholders this cost reduction project could impact.
- **Project Sponsor** - name the sponsor of the project.

I believe this template really helps procurement define key aspects of cost reduction projects. Resources are identified along with the project sponsor and key stakeholder alignment.
