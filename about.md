  Purchasing Toolpak Blog is about tools and templates for professional buyers.
</p>

Hi my name is David Mak, I am leading the effort to make procurement tools and templates available to all professional buyers. These
tools are used for strategic sourcing, procure to pay (transactional activities) and supplier integration.

## Why would you use these tools and templates?

* By not re-inventing the wheel these tools and templates will save you time.
* If you are a small company or organization - you now have access to templates and tools used by many professional buyers.
* Maybe you are new to procurement - use these templates to get up to speed quickly.
* Your organization lacks training materials and tools.



## How to get started?

Some tips about the setup of this project include:

* You can download all templates by clicking <a href="https://github.com/purchasingtoolpak/purchasingtoolpak/archive/master.zip">here</a>
* Templates are compatible with Microsoft Office for Windows, Mac, IOS and Android. In addition templates work with Apple Pages, Apache Open Office, Google Docs and Sheets.
* Designed and developed based upon the experience and knowledge or procurement professionals
