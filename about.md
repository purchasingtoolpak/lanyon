  Purchasing Toolpak Blog is about tools and templates for professional buyers.
</p>

Hi my name is David Mak, I am leading the effort to make procurement tools and templates available to all professional buyers. These
tools are used for strategic sourcing, procure to pay (transactional activities) and supplier integration.

## Why would you use these tools and templates?

* These tools and templates will save you time from re-inventing the wheel.
* If you are a small company or organization - you now have access to big company templates and tools.
* Maybe you are new to procurement and need to get up to speed quickly.
* Your organization lacks training materials and tools.



## How to get started?

Some tips about the setup of this project include:

* You can download all templates by clicking <a href="https://github.com/purchasingtoolpak/purchasingtoolpak/archive/master.zip">here</a>
* Templates are compatible with Microsoft Office for Windows, Mac, IOS and Android. In addition templates work with Apple Pages, Google Docs and Sheets. In addition you may use Apache Open Office
* Designed and developed based upon the experience and knowledge or procurement professionals
